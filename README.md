# Worldwide Mortality Analysis 2021

ABSTRACT:   
The effects of COVID-19 and how people around the world have fared are the topic of the World Happiness Report 2021. Our goal was twofold: first, to focus on COVID-19's consequences on the structure and quality of people's lives by determining the Mortality Rate, and second, to explain and analyse how Countries around the world responded with the epidemic. We try to explain why certain countries have lesser Mortality Rate than others in particular by visualization.
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the life factor factors considered in the reports reflect determinants that explain national-level disparities in life evaluations in the literature through extensive data exploration, cleansing and followed by the selection of appropriate visualization techniques.

OBJECTIVE:   
We focus on the effects of COVID-19 on the structure and quality of peopleâ€™s lives by determining the Mortality Rate and secondly to describe and evaluate how Countries all over the world have dealt with the pandemic

CONCLUSION:  
People who are in the age group of 20-30 years are most affected by COVID 19 in Most Countries.
Peru became the country with the highest COVID-19 Mortality rate in the world.
Belgium has most deaths per 1 Million Population and has the highest exposure to COVID 19 with the Index of 6.343.
There's a huge population difference in China and India due to Covid 19 Deaths.
As the Index of institutional trust increases, the deathrate is less based on trends.
Mortality Rate doesn't necessarily depend on Gini Coefficients of income of various Countries.
